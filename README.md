# Welcome to REACT (Resume Enhancement and Customization Tool)
This app hosted on streamlit takes user inputs to ultimately output a action-oriented and job description-focused resume, but still keeping the essence of the user's original resume submitted.

This app utilizes OpenAI's gpt models, Google's authentication model for logging in, and Stripe payment for paid features.
